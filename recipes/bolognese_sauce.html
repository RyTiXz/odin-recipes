    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>125 g Soy Granules</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 carrot</li>
            <li>½ celery roots</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika spices</li>
            <li>1 tsp dry oregano spices</li>
            <li>125 ml cup vegan red wine</li>
            <li>10 g cacao powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 can diced tomato</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>Salt & black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Direction</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Hydrate the soy protein in boiling water. The water should easily cover it, you need to get a tender “minced meat”, add as much water as you need. You can always use a colander to get rid of extra water.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat.            </li>
            <li>Chop the onion, carrot, garlic, and pepper. Transfer to a pot and sauté for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once onions are fragrant and translucent, add fresh herbs, tomato sauce and cacao powder. Then deglaze with wine.             </li>
            <li>bring to a simmer and cover for 10 minutes to let the wine cook down.            </li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes and maple syrup to the simmering vegetables. Stir to combine, season with salt and pepper, then cover again and let cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Finally, add the soy “meat” to the sauce, cook for about 20 minutes now.</li>
            <li>Serve with dinkel spirelli</li>
        </ol>
